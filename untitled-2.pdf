\subsection{Deep learning}

Convolutional neural networks are one type of deep learning methods. Figure \ref{fig:cnn-architecture} shows an example CNN architecture. Also figure \ref{fig:another-cnn} shows another CNN architecture.

\subsection{Computer vision}

We talk about previous works in computer vision. 

\section{Proposed method}

We describe our method in details. Equation \ref{eq:euclidean-distance} shows how we calculate Euclidean distance. Equation \ref{eq:random-equation} is just a random equation to illustrate how we write equations. Also $x_i = z_i^2$ is an inline equation.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:euclidean-distance}
D = \sqrt{ (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 }
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:random-equation}
\int e^{x+1} dx = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{x_i+1}{y_i+2}}
\end{equation}



\section{Results and discussion}

Our results outperform state of the art methods. Table \ref{table:results} shows our results.
