Git is a distributed version control system designed to efficiently handle everything from small to large-scale projects. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel, but it has since become one of the most widely used version control systems in the software development industry.

At its core, Git allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by providing them with a consistent and reliable way to track changes made to the codebase. Instead of relying on a centralized server, Git utilizes a distributed architecture where each developer has a complete copy of the project's entire history on their local machine. This enables developers to work on different parts of the project simultaneously and merge their changes seamlessly.
