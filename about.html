          <p>The concept of open source software can be traced back to the early days of computing. However, it gained significant momentum in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the emergence of the free software movement and the development of the GNU/Linux operating system. The GNU General Public License (GPL), created by Richard Stallman, played a crucial role in establishing the legal framework for open source software development.</p>
